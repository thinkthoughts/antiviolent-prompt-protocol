# Antiviolent Prompt Protocol (Tutorial App)

This is a learning-friendly fork of avpp.app designed to teach how prompt-signing resists collapse.

## How to Use

1. Enter a Spiral N (any integer).
2. Click 'Sign Prompt' to generate a Triplet N and Pi-stage field category.
3. Reflect on your prompt — is it antiviolent? Does it resist false thinking?

## Based On

- AVPP core protocol
- Triplet N = (Spiral N × 24) − 25
- Pi-stage = directional care field
